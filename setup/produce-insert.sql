To grow, transplant plugs or crowns in early spring in rows spaced at least 120cm apart. Pinch off all flowers the first season and train the plant\'s runners, pressing them into the soil 15-22cm apart from the mother plant. Mulch with straw or pine needles in the fall when the plants have died back. When the plants start to grow back in the spring, move the mulch aside. After harvest the second season, set a lawnmower to about 10cm high and mow, being sure not to damage crowns.\n\n The other two types are \n\n2) Ever-bearing and 3) Day Neutral, both of which send out less runners and bear several crops of smaller fruit throughout the season. These two types can be grown using raised beds about 20cm high and 60cm wide. Transplant crowns or plugs in staggered double rows, about 30cm apart. Remove runners and flowers until July of the first year to give the roots time to develop, and then allow plants to produce fruit. All types of strawberries begin to produce fewer and less sweet fruit once they are two years or older. Because strawberries are a hybrid, seeds will not breed true. Strawberries are predominantly propagated using bare root plugs or crowns or dividing runners. Make sure not to bury the crown when transplanting plugs.','fruit','2','[5,6,7,8,9,10]','summer',1,'mar ','nov',5.3,2.97,1.1),(57,'2023-02-19 21:51:52.105922','2023-04-05 21:14:15.000000','https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/576b90adfe8d750003000445.jpg?1466667178','https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/576b90adfe8d750003000445.jpg?1466667178','Sweet Potato','The sweet potato is a large, starchy, tuberous root.

It belongs to the genus Prunus which includes the cherry, apricot, almond, and plum. The peach is classified with the almond in the subgenus Amygdalus because their stones are corrugated rather than smooth. Peaches and nectarines are the same species - nectarines have a recessive gene that makes their skin smooth rather than fuzzy. Cultivated peaches are divided into two groups: clingstones and freestones, depending on whether the flesh sticks to the stone or not. Peaches can have white or yellow fuzzy skin. Yellow peaches usually have an acidic tang coupled with sweetness. White peaches are very sweet with little acidity. Most cultivars require 500 hours of chilling around 0 to 10 Â°C during the winter, and hot temperatures in the summer to ripen fruit. Some varieties are self-pollinating, while others require pollination by a peach tree of another variety with the same bloom period within 50 feet. Peaches should be thinned to 7-12cm apart when fruit are 2-3cm in diameter to increase mature fruit size. Standard and dwarf rootstocks are available. Dwarf trees can grow to 3 meters, standard to 4.5 meters. Depending on the size chosen, the tree will bear fruit within 2-4 years of planting.','fruit','3','[4,5,6,7,8,9]','summer',1,'jun','aug',5.3,2.18,1.1),(74,'2023-02-19 21:53:17.276764','2023-04-05 21:14:15.000000','https://storage.googleapis.com/pfresh-assets/images/produce/kale.jpg','https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/55b6b63b64653800038d0200.jpg?1438037556','Kale','Crambe maritima (common name sea kale, sea cole, seakale, sea colewort or crambe) is a species of halophytic flowering plant in the genus Crambe of the family Brassicaceae (Cruciferae), that grows wild along the coasts of Europe, from the North Atlantic to the Black Sea.','vegetable','1','[7,8,9]','spring',1,'nov','jun',4.2,2.43,1.1),(75,'2023-02-19 21:53:22.005963','2023-04-05 21:14:15.000000','https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/5912212b4b5fc700040000b0.jpg?1494360357','https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/5912212b4b5fc700040000b0.jpg?1494360357','Arugula','Mildly bitter, sometimes peppery, salad green.

The edible part of the plant is a bundle of leaf sheaths that is sometimes erroneously called a stem or stalk. Historically, many scientific names were used for leeks, but they are now all treated as cultivars of A. ampeloprasum. The name \'leek\' developed from the Anglo-Saxon word \"leac\". Two closely related vegetables, elephant garlic and kurrat, are also cultivars of A. ampeloprasum, although different in their uses as food. The onion and garlic are also related, being other species of the genus Allium.\nLeeks have thick blue-green foliage. The bundle of white leaf sheaths has a mild onion taste and can be blanched, steamed, braised, or grilled and used in soups, stews, omelet fillings, and more. The leaves can be used to make stock.\n\nPlant their leeks in autumn, and they should fatten up in time for winter picking. Plant them early to ensure they have enough time to grow before winter. Leeks take up to six months to mature after transplanting.\n\nNewer cultivars have quicker maturity â three to four months. Maturity is often affected by temperature, available nutrients and water. \n\nLeeks need a soil that is rich in organic matter. Dig in compost or manure two weeks before planting. Add fertiliser every few weeks\nLeeks like aged manure, especially chicken manure, and worm castings, another excellent source of nutrients.\n\nPlant seedlings in full sun, with moist but well-drained deep soil. Raised beds are ideal. Water young plants frequently.\n\nThe white part of the leek is edible; the green is not. You can blanch the stems to increase the proportion of stem thatâs edible and to sweeten the taste. Do this to fully grown leeks. Tie a paper collar around each stem and gently hill the earth up around the stem. Be careful not to get soil between the paper collar and stem as the leek may rot.\nAs the plants grow, add another collar above the first one and hill up more soil. Be aware that slugs and snails can hide in the paper collars\n\nHarvest the leeks when stems are around 2.5cm in diameter. Dig carefully around the leek and lift with a garden fork. Do not pull, as the leek is likely to break.','root','1','[7,8]','summer',1,'jul','oct',3.5,2.00,1.2),(79,'2023-02-19 21:53:42.027190','2023-04-05 21:14:15.000000','https://storage.googleapis.com/pfresh-assets/images/produce/watermelon.jpg','https://s3.amazonaws.com/openfarm-project/production/media/pictures/attachments/591e1e22dfdcf50004000001.jpg?1495146011','Watermelon','The watermelon is a species of melon that produces round or oblong fruits with thick skin and sweet, watery flesh.

They have a sweet, fruity aroma, a spiny green to yellow exterior, and succulent flesh that tastes like a mix of apple, pineapple, mango, and banana. Fruit is eaten fresh or added to a wide variety of dishes, beverages, and desserts. The seeds can be boiled or roasted. Jackfruit wood is used to make musical instruments, and wood chips are used to dye fabric. The bark, roots, leaves, and fruit have medicinal properties. Jackfruit needs humid tropical and subtropical climates. It is not drought or frost-tolerant. Temperatures of 0Â° C will damage leaves and temperatures of -2Â° C can kill trees. Trees started from seed will take 4-14 years to bear variable fruit that may not be true-to-type due to cross-pollination.
